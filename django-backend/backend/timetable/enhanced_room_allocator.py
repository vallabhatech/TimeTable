ENHANCED ROOM ALLOCATION SYSTEM
===============================
Implements the client's specific room allocation requirements:
- 2nd year batches: Academic building rooms for theory, labs for practicals
- 1st, 3rd, 4th year batches: Main building rooms for theory, labs for practicals
- All practicals must be in labs with 3 consecutive blocks in same lab
- No room conflicts
- Consistent room assignment per section per day
