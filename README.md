## 🧮 Algorithm Implementation

The system implements a **Deterministic Constraint-Based Algorithm** with controlled randomization:

### Key Characteristics:
- **Deterministic Core**: Same input always produces identical output for consistent scheduling
- **Constraint-Based Foundation**: All 19 academic constraints are strictly enforced
- **Controlled Randomization**: Random elements only when explicitly regenerating timetables
- **Predictable Results**: Ensures consistent timetables for same academic configuration

### Algorithm Components:

#### Final Universal Scheduler
- Deterministic constraint-based scheduling
- Enhanced room allocation with priority-based selection
- Gap filling for compact scheduling
- Section-based scheduling support

#### Enhanced Scheduler
- Advanced constraint validation
- Teacher unavailability handling
- Cross-semester conflict detection

#### Working Scheduler
- Basic conflict resolution
- Teacher and room constraint enforcement

#### Constraint Enforced Scheduler
- Systematic constraint validation
- Iterative conflict resolution

## ⚙️ Constraint System

The system enforces **19 constraints**:

#### Academic & Scheduling
1. **Subject Frequency** - Correct number of classes per week based on credits
2. **Practical Blocks** - 3-hour consecutive blocks for practical subjects
3. **Teacher Conflicts** - No teacher double-booking
4. **Room Conflicts** - No room double-booking
5. **Friday Time Limits** - Classes must not exceed 12:00/1:00 PM with practical, 11:00 AM without practical
6. **Minimum Daily Classes** - No day has only practical or only one class
7. **Thesis Day Constraint** - Wednesday is exclusively reserved for Thesis subjects for final year students
8. **Compact Scheduling** - Classes wrap up quickly while respecting Friday constraints
9. **Cross Semester Conflicts** - Prevents scheduling conflicts across batches
10. **Teacher Assignments** - Intelligent teacher assignment matching
11. **Friday Aware Scheduling** - Monday-Thursday scheduling considers Friday limits proactively
12. **Working Hours** - All classes are within 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM
13. **Same Lab Rule** - All 3 blocks of practical subjects must use the same lab
14. **Practicals in Labs** - Practical subjects must be scheduled only in laboratory rooms
15. **Room Consistency** - Enhanced room consistency for theory/practical separation
16. **Same Theory Subject Distribution** - Max 1 class per day, distributed across 5 weekdays
17. **Breaks Between Classes** - Minimal breaks, only when needed
18. **Teacher Breaks** - After 2 consecutive theory classes, teacher must have a break
19. **Teacher Unavailability** - Teachers cannot be scheduled during their unavailable periods

✅ **All 19 constraints have been successfully implemented and tested with real academic data from Software Engineering Department, including real faculty members, actual course structures, and comprehensive constraint validation.**
